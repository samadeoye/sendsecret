# SendSecret
This web application will allow for encoding and decoding of short secret messages.
The sender will type in the message and provide a 4-digit secret key which will be given to the receiver of the message, alongside a reference code which will be generated upon submission of the message.
The receiver on the other hand, will enter the reference received from the sender as well as the 4-digit secret key, then they get the plain text.
